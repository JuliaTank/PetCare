# PetCare
Android Application Project - Android dev course VIA University Collage 

Introducing an application that connects pet owners in need of caretakers and individuals who adore pets and wish to earn some extra money. This platform allows owners to post information about their pets, the duration of care required, and the price they are willing to pay for the service.

Traditional pet hotels tend to be expensive and accommodate a variety of animals, making it challenging for owners of particular or challenging pets to find suitable options. However, there are many people eager to dedicate their time to caring for pets in exchange for a reasonable fee. This application aims to bridge the gap between these two groups: owners and caretakers.

The primary objective of this application is to facilitate connections between pet owners and caretakers, ensuring that pets receive the care they need while owners are unavailable.
